The vehicles.py manages the dataset and it creates scatterplots and histogrems as it uses the data from the file. After that it saves the results in png and pdf files and because of some values which are missing, they are being converted into n/a. Lastly it is printing the following results: Mean, Median, Var, std and MAD(Median Absolute Deviation).
